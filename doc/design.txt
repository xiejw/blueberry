Repurpose the bb to use server client setup.

MLVM change
===========

Implement a redis-like server to response the query. The query can be:

1. op OP_CODE ...
2. batch n op ... op ...
3. new n dtype rank dims dtype rank dims

All queries end with new line \n.

Item 1 execute the op for single usage. It returns 0 if succeed; pre-defined
error code otherwise. Item 2 executes a batch of ops to avoid network
roundtrips. It returns two lines. The first is error code; 0 if succeed. The
second line is the number of op triggering the error. If the first line is 0,
the second line is missing.  Item 3 is to create the new fds. It returns new tds
for each line.

TODO: give some example here :)
