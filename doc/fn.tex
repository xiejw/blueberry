We want to design a function-based IR. It is SSA, and has no control-flow.
In addition, its interna values are not readable. So, the outputs are important
if the users want to pass the value out.

It supports autograd and optimized. Once done, it can be materilized to real
batch ops to run.

Any function starts with its down value number, e.g., 0, 1, 2, etc. They are not
same as the tensor descriptor used by vm. For consistency and convenience, 0 is
sitll the scalar 0 and 1 is still the scalar 1.
